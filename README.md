# ExchangeRateXml

## HOW TO RUN
Run ```php -f ExchangeRates.php```

## Improvements 
### Exchange Rates 
Extra feature would be to allow users add in there own exchange rates using the argv. 
### Xml Sort 
The toXml function should really be abstracted a bit more specially when the key becomes products as its a recursive function and ideally have one purpose.
